# Liscence-Plate-Detection

# About the project:
The project uses Python and OpenCV to return the license plate number of the car (if any) in the image given as input.
Follows the Haar Cascade Algorithm for the detection.  
  
Future expectations:  
Once the number is recieved in string form, a search through databases that store liense plate numbers of cars used for criminal activities can be quickly performed. This would help tracking the cars as soon as possible, helping with crime reduction.  
Improvement in quality of image detection

# Sample Run:
The sample image can be used to test run the code.

# Collaborators:
This project is undertaken in collaboration with Shaleen Malik[https://github.com/Shaleen-62].
